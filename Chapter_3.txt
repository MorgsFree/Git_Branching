In recent years, there has been a growing movement advocating for improved welfare and ethical treatment of pigs, both in farming and research settings. Advances in sustainable farming practices emphasize the importance of providing pigs with more natural living conditions, allowing them to exhibit their instinctual behaviors. This shift not only benefits the animals but also leads to healthier, higher-quality products for consumers. Additionally, pigs have found roles as therapy animals, showcasing their gentle and empathetic nature in helping individuals with emotional and psychological needs. As our understanding and appreciation of pigs continue to evolve, these intelligent and versatile animals are increasingly recognized for their intrinsic value beyond their economic contributions, highlighting the need for a more compassionate and respectful approach to their care and management.
